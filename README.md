Make a copy of your file `html-intro.html`. Name it to be `HW-1-2.html` The easiest way to do this is to file -- save as, and rename. Make sure it is in the correct location!

Your file should already include the following:

* DOCTYPE declaration
* html element
* head element
* title element
* body element

Each section should have text written in it. Choose a theme for your website, and make sure all areas fit within it!

Add to your code the following items:
* at least 3 different heading options
* an ordered list of at least 5 different items
* an unordered list of at least 10 different items

Be sure to use proper indentation!
